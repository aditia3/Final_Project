# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The monte carlo scenario which we are planning to simulate is of a customer care service center. Everytime we have any complaint regarding any service we use, we tend to call the customer care service available for the product. During the calls we are always placed on hold till our turn arrives. 

In this simulation we are randomly trying to generate customers in queue with a certain wait time(time for which the customer is willing to wait in queue - patience time) and call duration assigned  to them. Our aim is to determine the right balance between the number of customers and customer care representatives.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
The random variable we are considering are:
(i) call duration of the customer 
(ii) time for which the customer is willing to wait

There will be call drops because people will lose patience and cut calls.
The simulation will help us determine the number of representatives needed to reduce the call drops.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
We are assuming as the number of representatives increase, there would be less wait time and less call drops.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

Assumptions made:
All representatives have the same efficiency.
There is no rest time for the representatives.
Every customer will have atleast 1min of time for which they will be willing to wait.
The customer will be served on first come first serve basis.
There is only one single queue for customers.
