# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The monte carlo scenario which we are planning to simulate is of a customer care service center. Everytime we have any complaint regarding any service we use, we tend to call the customer care service available for the product. During the calls we are always placed on hold till our turn arrives. 

In this simulation we are randomly trying to generate customers in queue with a certain wait time assigned to them. Our aim is to determine the right balance between the number of customer care representatives.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
The random variable we are considering are:
(i) number of people in queue 
(ii) waiting time for the caller to reach representative

There can also be call abandons due to long wait times
The simulation will help us determine the number of representatives needed to reduce the call drops.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
We are assuming as the number of representatives increase, there would be less wait time and less call drops.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

Assumptions made:
All Reps have the same efficiency.
There is no rest time for the Reps.
